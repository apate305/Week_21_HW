# 2.	What kind of API did you build? What types of APIs are there? Why are APIs important?

The API created was a RESTful API using the flask framework. This API was first accessed locally 

## Why APIs are important:

APIs are extremely useful to our day to day life and also for companies/businesses. It is actually used all the time. We can access many applications from our phones due to an API call. 

## APIs or Application Programming Interface 

APIs Application Programming Interface: allows application to interact with other parts of architecture: like a database or another application. It is a piping that connects systems together and allows them to talk to each other. In other words, an API allows one program to access the data and services of another. 

## Types of APIs

### Web APIs
Web APIs are most popular but they are limited to the web.
An example would be if you want to log into your instagram account on your iphone, the iphone would make a call to an API so that it can retreive your instagram account. Then instagram would access this information from one of its servers and return it to the iphone. 

### REST APIs

REST is a design style for software like web APIs  

There are five design constraints that result in an app with properties, like performance, simplicity, and reliability.

Web APIs that have the constraints of REST are called REST APIs. 

FUN FACT: the libraries we use in python are actually APIs!

### FLASK APIs

Flask is the easiest API framework to use. 

Flask is a “micro web application” framework. You can use it to make simple applications. We used it to make APIs

Framework – collection of libraries that let developers create scalable, maintainable, and reliable code by using certain patterns

FLASK is combining a bunch of different libraries and established patterns 

When we spin up the flask app on our local machine, it is going to open a browser and we will see the app on  127001 or localhost/home computer. We use this as a placeholder. No website can have a IEP address with 127. 

We will build an app through the command line and it shows up in browser. And that shows you whats going to be in the application when you deploy it in the cloud in Azure
